We have to currently make graphs for these 3 files
1. CoinHistoryOnAParticularDate.py
2. CoinHistoricalData1.py
3. CoinHistoricalData2.py
In future we have to add more.
How and what data will these graphs represent is written in comments.

This is the place where charts will be made -   https://www.chartjs.org/
Good samples are given. One just have to see what data is represented in these samples and change with their own data.
